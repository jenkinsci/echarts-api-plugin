Provides https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html[ECharts] for Jenkins Plugins. ECharts is an open-sourced
JavaScript visualization tool to create intuitive, interactive, and highly-customizable charts. It
can run fluently on PC and mobile devices and it is compatible with most modern
Web Browsers.

This plugin contains the latest https://www.webjars.org[WebJars] release and corresponding Jenkins UI elements.

== How to use the plugin

A Jenkins plugin typically also reports some kind of trend from build to build. Up to now Jenkins core provides only a
quite limited concept of rendering such trends as trend charts. The
http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/[JFreeChart framework] offered by Jenkins core is a server
side rendering engine that creates charts as static PNG images that will be included on the job and details pages.
Nowadays, several powerful JS based charting libraries are available, that do the same job
(well actually an even better job) on the client side. That has the advantage that these charts can be customized
on each client without affecting the server performance. Moreover, you get a lot of additional
features (like zooming, animation, etc.) for free. Additionally, these charting libraries not only support the typical
build trend charts but also a lot of additional charts types that can be used to improve the user experience of
a plugin.
One of those charting libraries is https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html[ECharts]. This library has a powerful API
and supports literally every chart type one can image of. You can get some impressions of the features on the
https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/[examples page] of the library.

In order to use these charts one can embed charts that use this library by importing the corresponding JS files and by
defining the chart in the corresponding Jelly file. While that already works quite well it
will be still somewhat cumbersome to provide the corresponding model for these charts from Jenkins build results. So I
I added a powerful Java API that helps to create the model for these charts on the Java side. This API provides the
following features:

- Create trend charts based on a collection of build results.
- Separate the chart type from the aggregation in order to simplify unit testing of the chart model.
- Toggle the type of the X-Axis between build number or build date (with automatic aggregation of results that
have been recorded at the same day).
- Automatic conversion of the Java model to the required JSON model for the JS side.
- Support for pie and line charts (more to come soon).

Those charts can be used as trend chart in the project page (see <<img-trend>>) or as information chart in the details
view of a plugin (see <<reporter-detail>>).

[#pie-charts]
=== Pie charts

A simple but still informative chart is a pie chart that illustrates numerical proportions of plugin data. In the Forensics
plugin such a chart show the numerical proportions of the number of authors or commits for the
source code files in the Git repository. In the warnings plugin such a chart shows the
numerical proportions of the new, outstanding, or fixed warnings, see <<img-pie>>.

.Pie chart in the Warnings plugin
[#img-pie]
image::pie.png[Pie chart example,width=60%]

In order to include such a chart in your details view, you can use the provided `pie-chart` tag.
In the following snippet you see this tag in action (embedded in a https://github.com/jenkinsci/bootstrap4-api-plugin[Bootstrap card]):

[source,xml,linenums]
.index.jelly
----
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core"  xmlns:c="/charts" xmlns:bs="/bootstrap">

    [...]
    <bs:card title="${%Number of authors}" fontAwesomeIcon="users">
      <c:pie-chart id="authors" model="${it.authorsModel}" height="256" />
    </bs:card>
    [...]

</j:jelly>
----

You need to provide a unique ID for this chart and the corresponding model value. The model must be the JSON
representation of a corresponding `PieChartModel` instance. Such a model can be created with a couple of lines:

[source,java,linenums]
.ViewModel.java
----
[...]
PieChartModel model = new PieChartModel("Title");

model.add(new PieData("Segment 1 name", 10), Palette.RED);
model.add(new PieData("Segment 2 name", 15), Palette.GREEN);
model.add(new PieData("Segment 3 name", 20), Palette.YELLOW);

String json = new JacksonFacade().toJson(model);
[...]
----

[#progress-charts]
=== Progress charts

Another simple chart (that is based on a pie chart) is the progress chart. Using this chart you can render
a simple progress value using a pie chart as backend.

.Progress chart in the Autograding plugin
[#img-progress]
image::progress.png[Pie chart example]

In order to include such a chart in your details view, you can use the provided `progress-chart` tag.
In the following snippet you see this tag in action (embedded in a https://github.com/jenkinsci/bootstrap4-api-plugin[Bootstrap card]):

[source,xml,linenums]
.index.jelly
----
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core"  xmlns:c="/charts" xmlns:bs="/bootstrap">

    [...]
    <bs:card title="${%Autograding score}" fontAwesomeIcon="graduation-cap">
      <c:progress-chart id="total-progress" model="${it.getProgressModel(80)}" height="150"
                        value="80" tooltip="80% is very good"/>
    </bs:card>
    [...]

</j:jelly>
----

You need to provide a unique ID for this chart and the corresponding model value. The model must be the JSON
representation of a corresponding `PieChartModel` instance. Such a model can be created with a couple of lines,
see the class https://github.com/jenkinsci/autograding-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/grading/PercentagePieChart.java[PercentagePieChart].


[#trend-charts]
=== Trend charts on the job level view

In order to show a trend that renders a line chart on the job page (see <<img-trend>>) you need to provide a so called
floating box (stored in the file `floatingBox.jelly` of your job action (see <<jenkins-chart-model>>)).
The content of this file is quite simple and contains just a `trend-chart` tag:

[source,xml,linenums]
.floatingBox.jelly
----
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:c="/charts">

  <c:trend-chart it="${from}" title="${%SCM Files Count Trend}" enableLinks="true"/>

</j:jelly>
----

On the Java side the model for the chart needs to be provided in the corresponding sub class of `JobAction` (which is
the owner of the floating box). Since the computation of trend charts is quite expensive on the server side as well
(several builds need to be read from disk and the interesting data points need to be computed) this process has been
put into a separate background job. Once the computation is done the result is shown via an Ajax call. In order to
hide these details for plugin authors you should simply derive your `JobAction` class from the corresponding
`AsyncTrendJobAction` class, that already contains the boilerplate code. So your static plugin object model will actually
become a little bit more complex:


[#jenkins-chart-model]
.Jenkins chart model design
image::chart-model.png[Jenkins chart model]

Basically, you need to implement the method `LinesChartModel createChartModel()` to create the line
chart. This method is quite simple to implement, since most of the hard work is provided by the library. You will be
invoked with an iterator of your build actions, starting with the latest build. The iterator advances from build to build
until no more results are available (or the maximum number of builds to consider has been reached). The most important
thing to implement in your plugin is the way how data points are computed for a given `BuildAction`. Here is an example of
such a `SeriesBuilder` implementation in the Forensics Plugin:

[source,java,linenums]
.FilesCountSeriesBuilder.java
----
package io.jenkins.plugins.forensics.miner;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import edu.hm.hafner.echarts.SeriesBuilder;

/**
 * Builds one x-axis point for the series of a line chart showing the number of files in the repository.
 *
 * @author Ullrich Hafner
 */
public class FilesCountSeriesBuilder extends SeriesBuilder<ForensicsBuildAction> {
    static final String TOTALS_KEY = "total";

    @Override
    protected Map<String, Integer> computeSeries(final ForensicsBuildAction current) {
        Map<String, Integer> series = new HashMap<>();
        series.put(TOTALS_KEY, current.getNumberOfFiles());
        return series;
    }
}
----

You are not limited to a single line chart. You can show several lines in a single chart, you can show stacked values,
or even the delta between some values. You can also have a look at the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/tree/master/src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/analysis/core/charts[charts of the warnings plugin]
to see some of these features in detail.

You can find several examples of Jenkins views that use ECharts in the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Warnings Next Generation plugin]
and in the https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Forensics plugin].
